# Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners
This repo contains an analysis on a dataset of all Nobel Prize winners available on https://www.datacamp.com/projects/441. 

The questions we are trying to address are the following: 
1. Investigating the correlation between the gender-ratio of the Nobel Prize winners and the decades.
2. Investigating the correlation between the gender-ratio of the Nobel Prize winners and the categories.
3. Investigating the correlation between the average age of winners at the time of winning and the years.
4. Investigating the ratio between prizes that are shared and those that are not shared in each category.
